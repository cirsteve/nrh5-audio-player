First pass at limited functionality for an html5 media player and node web server. As of now the app displays the currently playing track info as well as track info for upcoming tracks on the playlist and includes a skip button to remove the current track from the playlist and advance to the next track. The playlist is currently generated on server start by manually saving several song objects to the redis database in the format {"song":"song title","artist":"song artist","album":"song album", "url":"/path/to/song/file.ogg"}.
